  "T4a was designed as a multi-wave study to measure each defense layer's specific contribution against one canonical attack class. Wave 1 ran with temporal enforcement in log-only mode to establish the counterfactual baseline (100% pass). Wave 2 enabled cross-modal temporal coupling enforcement (10% pass — the 90 percentage-point reduction isolates that layer's contribution). Wave 3 enabled phrase content binding on top of temporal enforcement (0% pass — the final closure of the pre-recorded-arbitrary-content attack class). Wave 4 confirmed the result at scale (1,000 attempts, 0% pass, 95% CI [0%, 0.37%]). Combined defense stack drops T4a from 100% to 0%.";
