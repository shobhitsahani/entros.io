    title: "Sybil-Resistant Airdrops",
    category: "DeFi",
    problem:
      "Jupiter filtered 750,000+ wallets as sybil before Jupuary 2025 distribution. The 2026 round was cut sharply by DAO vote and postponed. Every major Solana airdrop relitigates sybil from scratch because existing identity checks verify a moment, not sustained human presence over time.",
    solution:
      "Gate airdrop claims on Entros Anchor with a minimum Trust Score (e.g., 500+). Trust Score requires sustained re-verification over time, making bot farming slow and expensive. Progressive scoring means 100 verifications in one day scores less than weekly verifications over 3 months.",
    example:
      "An airdrop integrator gates claims on Entros Trust Score (e.g., 200+ requires at least two re-verifications spaced over time). The protocol stays public and open; only verified humans pass the eligibility tier alongside existing token-balance and activity rules. Bot farms must fund wallets, pay per-verification SOL, and maintain Trust Score across separate days for every fake identity.",

    title: "Verified Governance",
    category: "DAOs",
    problem:
      "Token-weighted governance fails at predictable moments. Mango Markets 2022: Avi Eisenberg used his MNGO position to vote a proposal keeping $47M of his own oracle-manipulation drain. Chainalysis found that across major DAOs, under 1% of holders control over 90% of voting power, with turnout typically below 10%. Token weight is not community will.",
    solution:
      "Voters must hold an Entros Anchor with minimum Trust Score and recent verification. The Realms voter-weight plugin gates voting on verified-personhood, not token holdings. The whale's bag becomes one vote. Spam-quorum requires verified humans, not allocations.",
    example:
      "A DAO using Realms gates voting on Entros Trust Score, not just token holdings. One human, one vote—verified behaviorally in 12 seconds on any device. Plugin shipped on devnet, spl-governance compatible.",

    title: "Fair Mints and Competitions",
    category: "NFT / DeFi",
    problem:
      "NFT drops at launch are bot-minted at scale. Referral programs and trading competitions on perp DEXes get sybil-farmed across hundreds of accounts. Filtering wallets without collecting identity documents remains a gap.",
    solution:
      "Mint gate: one human per allocation, verified by Anchor. Competition entry: require Anchor age > 30 days and recent verification. Short-lived bot accounts with zero trust cannot qualify. Each verification costs the user SOL, making large-scale bot farming economically punitive at the protocol layer.",
    example:
      "An NFT marketplace can require Entros verification for mint allowlists on a per-collection basis. A perp DEX can gate referral-multiplier rewards or trading-competition entry on Trust Score above a threshold. Optional eligibility tier on top of existing rules—not a KYC replacement.",

    title: "Creator Verification",
    category: "Creators",
    problem:
      "Scammers mint NFT collections under stolen brands. Buyers cannot distinguish real creators from impersonators.",
    solution:
      "Creators register with an Entros Anchor. Collection metadata includes a cryptographic commitment to the creator's Anchor. Buyers verify provenance on-chain. The Anchor's Trust Score signals how long the creator has maintained their verified identity.",
    example:
      "A creator-tooling platform on Metaplex Core can include an Entros Anchor reference in collection metadata. Marketplaces displaying that metadata can render a 'Verified Creator' badge for Anchored artists. Token-2022 NonTransferable + Metaplex Core compose natively—the same primitive choices Entros's Agent Anchor uses today.",

    title: "Bot Prevention",
    category: "Social",
    problem:
      "Reward platforms and content distribution apps are overrun by bot accounts farming rewards, inflating engagement metrics, and crowding out real users.",
    solution:
      "Require Entros verification at account creation or reward claim. The closed-source defense layer rejects synthetic inputs before they reach the chain. Each verification costs the user SOL, making large-scale farming economically punitive at the protocol layer.",
    example:
      "A creator-rewards platform can gate reward claims on Entros Trust Score. Each fake identity requires a funded wallet, per-verification SOL, and sustained re-verification across multiple days to clear meaningful thresholds.",
