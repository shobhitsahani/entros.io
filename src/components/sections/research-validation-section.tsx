            Entros captures voice, movement, and touch simultaneously
            and verifies their temporal correlation. Spoofing one
            modality in isolation is feasible. Spoofing all three with
            consistent behavioral characteristics across modalities is
            an exponentially harder problem. Trust Score then requires
            maintaining that consistency across sessions over weeks,
            compounding the difficulty further.
